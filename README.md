Muffin Wars - submission for mindhack2014
=========================================

Muffin Wars is a Pokemon-esque mobile game developed for android. In MW, instead of players collecting Pokemon they collect muffins (why muffins, you ask? Why not, we say!). 

These muffins are found and added to a player's collection by scanning random QR codes, each of which generates a new muffin for the player. Players then pit their muffins against their friend's muffins in what amounts to a no-holds-barred fight to the death. This results in a thought-provoking contrast between the whimsy of anthropomorphic baked goods and the gritty realism of mortal combat. 

In short, Muffin Wars isn't merely the love child of a caffeine-fuelled 12 hour code orgy, it's also a highly cerebral commentary on the existential crisis. Okay, I admit the previous sentence is totally untrue, we're just trying to make this whole muffin idea seem legit. 

We've also completely failed to explain the lobsters -- and by the way, the game also has lobsters, which we COULD explain, but won't ;)
